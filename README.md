<h1>FileFire</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
FileFire is a cloud storage application that I developed using React, SASS, Material-UI, and Firebase. I used Google Drive as my inspiration. Total development time was four weeks. The experience I gained was invaluable, and this project was the most beneficial learning resource thus far in my journey to becoming a web developer.
